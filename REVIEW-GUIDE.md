# 🔍 Multitrack Timeline - Review & Testing Guide

## Welcome to Your Review!

This guide will walk you through testing every feature of the new multitrack timeline system. Follow step-by-step to verify everything works.

---

## 📋 Pre-Flight Checklist

Before you start, make sure you have:

- [ ] Node.js installed (v16+)
- [ ] npm or pnpm package manager
- [ ] Terminal/command line access
- [ ] Code editor (VS Code recommended)
- [ ] ~30 minutes for full review

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Install & Run Tests

### 1.1 Install Dependencies

```bash
cd /Users/finessevanes/Desktop/gauntlet-03.1
npm install
```

**Expected output:**
- All packages install successfully
- TypeScript upgraded to 5.6
- Vitest installed

**⚠️ If you see errors:**
- Check Node version: `node --version` (should be v16+)
- Try `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` if peer dependency issues

---

### 1.2 Run Unit Tests

```bash
npm test
```

**What to look for:**
```
✓ Timeline Schema (2 tests)
  ✓ creates empty timeline with main track
  ✓ converts seconds to ticks correctly

✓ Invariants (4 tests)
  ✓ validates gapless main track
  ✓ detects gap in main track
  ✓ detects overlap in main track
  ✓ normalizes unsorted clips

✓ Migration (3 tests)
  ✓ migrates old session to new TimelineDoc
  ✓ auto-detects and migrates old format
  ✓ recognizes new format

✓ Insert Operation (3 tests)
  ✓ inserts clip to empty main track
  ✓ inserts clip and ripples downstream
  ✓ appends clip to end of main track

✓ Delete Operation (2 tests)
  ✓ deletes clip and ripples left (auto-compact)
  ✓ deletes first clip and shifts remaining left

✓ Split Operation (2 tests)
  ✓ splits clip into two segments
  ✓ preserves linked groups on split

✓ Trim Operation (3 tests)
  ✓ trims clip and ripples downstream
  ✓ trimIn adjusts in-point correctly
  ✓ trimOut adjusts out-point correctly

✓ Move Operation (1 test)
  ✓ moves clip within main track (reorder)

✓ Complex Scenarios (2 tests)
  ✓ handles insert → split → delete sequence
  ✓ maintains gapless after multiple operations

Test Files  2 passed (2)
     Tests  22 passed (22)
  Duration  XXXms
```

**✅ Success Criteria:**
- All 22+ tests pass
- No red "FAIL" messages
- Duration under 5 seconds

**❌ If tests fail:**
1. Read error messages carefully
2. Check that TypeScript upgraded (`npx tsc --version` should show 5.x)
3. Try `npm run test:run` (run once, no watch mode)

---

## 🧪 Step 2: Manual Testing with Playground

### 2.1 Review the Playground Code

Open `src/timeline/__tests__/manual-playground.ts` in your editor.

**What it does:**
1. Creates empty timeline
2. Inserts 3 clips
3. Shows auto-compact in action
4. Migrates old session format

**Read through and understand:**
- How `secondsToTicks()` converts time
- How `insertClip()` works
- How `validateTimeline()` checks invariants

### 2.2 Test Operations in Node Console

Open a Node REPL and try operations:

```bash
node
```

```javascript
// Copy/paste these one at a time:

// Import types
const { createEmptyTimeline, secondsToTicks } = require('./src/types/timeline.ts');

// Create timeline
const doc = createEmptyTimeline();
console.log('Tracks:', doc.tracks.length);
console.log('Main track lanes:', doc.tracks[0].lanes.length);

// Convert time
const fiveSeconds = secondsToTicks(5, 1000);
console.log('5 seconds in ticks:', fiveSeconds); // Should be 5000
```

**Note:** Node may not support TypeScript directly. If errors, skip to Step 3.

---

## 🎨 Step 3: Visual Demo (Coming Soon)

### 3.1 Set Up Demo Route

To see the UI, you need to render the TimelineDemo component.

**Option A: Add to existing app**

Find your main app entry point (e.g., `src/renderer.tsx` or `src/App.tsx`) and add:

```tsx
import { TimelineDemo } from './components/v2/TimelineDemo';

// Replace your current render with:
<TimelineDemo />
```

**Option B: Create standalone demo page**

Create `src/demo.tsx`:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import { TimelineDemo } from './components/v2/TimelineDemo';
import './index.css'; // Your Tailwind CSS

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <TimelineDemo />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

Then run:
```bash
npm start
```

---

### 3.2 Visual Testing Checklist

Once the demo loads, verify:

#### **Timeline Layout**
- [ ] Top toolbar with "Timeline V2" title
- [ ] Undo/Redo buttons (gray = disabled, blue = enabled)
- [ ] Snapping indicator (green dot = ON)
- [ ] Zoom level displayed
- [ ] Ruler with time markers (0s, 1s, 2s, etc.)
- [ ] Red playhead line with circle at top
- [ ] Track with header and clips
- [ ] Bottom status bar with playhead time, duration, selection

#### **Demo Data**
- [ ] 3 clips visible on main track
- [ ] Clips have different colors
- [ ] Clips show duration (e.g., "5.00s")
- [ ] No gaps between clips (gapless)
- [ ] First clip starts at 0s

#### **Track Header**

- [ ] Collapse/expand arrow button
- [ ] Track name: "Main Video"
- [ ] "Main" badge
- [ ] "VIDEO" type label
- [ ] "1 lane" count

---

## 🖱️ Step 4: Interactive Testing

### 4.1 Click Playhead

**Action:** Click anywhere on the timeline (gray area)

**Expected:**
- Red playhead moves to clicked position
- Playhead snaps to nearest second (grid snapping)
- Bottom status bar updates playhead time
- If close to clip edge, snaps to edge

**Hold Shift + Click:**
- Snapping disabled (gray dot indicator)
- Playhead goes to exact clicked position

---

### 4.2 Select Clip

**Action:** Click on a clip

**Expected:**
- Clip gets blue border
- "ring" highlight around clip
- Background color changes to blue
- Bottom status bar shows "Selected: 1 clip"

---

### 4.3 Hover Clip Edges

**Action:** Hover mouse over clip's left or right edge

**Expected:**
- Cursor changes to resize cursor (↔)
- Blue line appears at edge
- Stays as resize cursor within 8px of edge
- Reverts to move cursor in middle

---

### 4.4 Add New Clip

**Action:** Click "+ Add Clip" button

**Expected:**
- New clip appears at end of timeline
- Duration: 2 seconds
- Appended after last clip (gapless)
- Timeline extends to accommodate
- Auto-scroll to see new clip (if needed)

**Try adding 5 clips:**
- All clips should be gapless
- No overlaps
- Each new clip at end

---

### 4.5 Test Undo/Redo

**Action:** After adding clips, click "Undo" button (or press Cmd+Z)

**Expected:**
- Last clip disappears
- Timeline shrinks
- Button shows updated count
- Playhead preserved

**Action:** Click "Redo" button (or press Cmd+Shift+Z)

**Expected:**
- Clip reappears
- Timeline extends again
- Exactly as it was before undo

**Try:**
1. Add 3 clips
2. Undo 3 times (back to original 3 clips)
3. Redo 3 times (back to 6 clips)
4. Undo all the way (back to 3 clips)

---

### 4.6 Test Snapping

**Action:** Click near (but not exactly on) a clip edge

**Expected:**
- Playhead snaps to clip edge
- Green dot indicator (snapping ON)

**Action:** Hold Shift, click near clip edge

**Expected:**
- Playhead goes to exact click position (no snap)
- Gray dot indicator (snapping OFF)

**Release Shift:**
- Green dot returns (snapping ON)

---

### 4.7 Reset Demo

**Action:** Click "Reset Demo" button

**Expected:**
- Timeline clears
- Reloads with original 3 clips
- Undo/redo stacks clear
- Playhead resets to 0s

---

## 🔍 Step 5: Code Review

### 5.1 Review Type Definitions

**File:** `src/types/timeline.ts`

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Understand `Tick` type (integer timebase)
- [ ] Review `Clip` interface (id, sourceId, srcStart, duration, start, etc.)
- [ ] Review `Lane` interface (id, clips[])
- [ ] Review `Track` interface (id, type, role, lanes[], policy)
- [ ] Review `TrackPolicy` interface (isMagnetic, defaultMode, etc.)
- [ ] Check `TRACK_POLICY_PRESETS` (main, overlay, audio)

**Key concepts:**
- `srcStart`: Where in the source file clip starts
- `duration`: How long clip is on timeline
- `start`: Absolute position on timeline
- `linkedGroupId`: For A/V linking

---

### 5.2 Review Auto-Compact Logic

**File:** `src/timeline/operations/delete.ts`

**Find the `repackMainLane()` function:**

```typescript
function repackMainLane(lane: any): void {
  let currentStart = 0;
  for (const clip of lane.clips) {
    clip.start = currentStart;
    currentStart += clip.duration;
  }
}
```

**This is called after every edit on main track!**

**Verify it's used in:**
- [ ] `delete.ts` - after removing clip
- [ ] `insert.ts` - after inserting clip
- [ ] `trim.ts` - after changing duration
- [ ] `move.ts` - after reordering clips

---

### 5.3 Review Invariant Checks

**File:** `src/timeline/invariants.ts`

**Find `assertMainLaneGapless()`:**

```typescript
export function assertMainLaneGapless(doc: TimelineDoc): void {
  const mainTrack = doc.tracks.find((t) => t.role === 'main')!;
  const lane = mainTrack.lanes[0];

  for (let i = 0; i < lane.clips.length - 1; i++) {
    const current = lane.clips[i];
    const next = lane.clips[i + 1];
    const currentEnd = current.start + current.duration;

    if (currentEnd !== next.start) {
      throw new Error('Main lane must be gapless...');
    }
  }
}
```

**Understand:**
- Loops through adjacent clips
- Checks that `current.end === next.start`
- Throws error if gap or overlap found
- Called after every operation

---

### 5.4 Review Command Pattern

**File:** `src/timeline/commands/InsertCommand.ts`

**Structure:**

```typescript
export class InsertCommand extends BaseCommand {
  private beforeState: TimelineDoc | null = null;

  do(doc: TimelineDoc): TimelineDoc {
    this.beforeState = structuredClone(doc);
    return insertClip(doc, this.options);
  }

  undo(doc: TimelineDoc): TimelineDoc {
    if (!this.beforeState) throw new Error('Cannot undo');
    return this.beforeState;
  }
}
```

**Understand:**
- `do()` saves state before executing
- `undo()` restores saved state
- Simple state-swapping (no complex patches)
- Works for all operations

---

### 5.5 Review Store Integration

**File:** `src/store/timelineStore.ts`

**Find `executeCommand()` action:**

```typescript
executeCommand: (cmd: Command) => {
  const { doc, undoStack } = get();

  const newDoc = cmd.do(doc);
  assertTimelineInvariants(newDoc); // Validate!

  set({
    doc: newDoc,
    undoStack: [...undoStack, cmd],
    redoStack: [], // Clear redo on new action
  });

  get().saveToBackend();
}
```

**Understand:**
- Executes command
- Validates invariants (throws if invalid)
- Adds to undo stack
- Clears redo stack
- Saves to backend

---

## 🐛 Step 7: Known Limitations & Edge Cases

### Current Limitations

These are **expected** and **documented**:

1. **Ghost preview during drag**: Not implemented yet (UI polish)
   - Clips can be selected, but dragging not fully wired up
   - Trim hover detection works, but actual trimming UI pending

2. **Track creation UI**: Not exposed yet
   - Only main track exists in demo
   - Can add overlay tracks programmatically
   - UI for "+ Add Track" button pending

3. **IPC integration**: New operations not wired to Electron main process
   - Store works in renderer only
   - Need to update IPC handlers to use new operations

4. **Library → Timeline drag**: Not implemented
   - Can add clips via button
   - Drag-and-drop from library pending

### Edge Cases to Test

Try these scenarios and verify they work:

#### **Empty Timeline**
- [ ] Clicking on empty timeline sets playhead
- [ ] Adding first clip starts at 0
- [ ] Undo removes clip, back to empty

#### **Single Clip**
- [ ] Deleting only clip returns to empty
- [ ] Splitting creates 2 clips at 0 and midpoint
- [ ] Trimming maintains start at 0

#### **Many Clips**
- [ ] Add 20 clips (click button 20 times)
- [ ] Timeline scrolls horizontally
- [ ] All clips gapless
- [ ] Undo works (try undoing 10 times)
- [ ] Performance feels smooth

#### **Playhead**
- [ ] Playhead can be before first clip
- [ ] Playhead can be after last clip
- [ ] Playhead preserved on undo/redo
- [ ] Playhead updates in status bar

#### **Snapping**
- [ ] Snapping works near edges (within ~100ms)
- [ ] Snapping works on grid boundaries
- [ ] Shift disables for precise positioning
